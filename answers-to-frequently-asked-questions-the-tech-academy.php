								<p>The short answer: since 2012.</p>
								<p>Erik Gross (Co-Founder of The Tech Academy) has been training developers since the 1990s. In 2012, he decided to launch his own programming boot camp under the name "Prosper I.T. Academy". The program has been running since then.</p>
								<p>At the end of 2013, Erik partnered with Jack Stanley. They spent months on curriculum development and in early 2014, re-branded as The Tech Academy.</p>

								<p>Our program is self-paced. We are open weekdays, weeknights and weekends. We recommend students study a minimum of 40 hours a week at our school because this best guarantees they will complete their training within the normal time period. </p>
								<p>40 hours a week is not required and we are flexible. Some students work full-time concurrently to taking our program, so they work on our program part-time. We work with students so that they can study on a schedule that is most convenient for them. </p>
								<p>Two factors that should be taken into account though are:<br>&emsp; 1.  We require a minimum of 20 hours of study per week,<br>&emsp; 2.  Students who study 40 hours or more a week are granted &emsp;&emsp; a scholarship of $1,000 off the full tuition price.  </p>

								</p>
								<p>We work hard to ensure that every graduate lands a job.</p>
								<p>
									At the end of the day, we can't get a job for students, so the 95% placement rate is really the product of persistence on the part of students and

									Students are granted a pro-rated refund based on the date they signed their enrollment agreement. 
									It is calculated based on the number of weeks that have passed since the date on the enrollment agreement (not on hours studied, credits obtained, etc.)
									and regardless of time taken off the program (for example: if the student was not studying during the time that passed or if they were on a leave of absence, the weeks are still counted as time since the date of enrollment).
									Refunds are counted against the number of calendar weeks that have passed since the date on the Enrollment Agreement and regardless of any other factors. 
									No refunds are granted 50% in to the program (i.e. after 7 ½ weeks have passed since the date on the enrollment agreement). 
								</p>
								<p>
									Specifically, if a student requests a refund (the following percentages were rounded):<br>
									5 days or less after the date on the Enrollment Agreement = full refund<br>
									1 week after the date on the Enrollment Agreement = 93% refund<br>
									2 weeks after the date on the Enrollment Agreement = 86% refund<br>
									3 weeks after the date on the Enrollment Agreement = 79% refund<br>
									4 weeks after the date on the Enrollment Agreement = 73% refund<br>
									5 weeks after the date on the Enrollment Agreement = 66% refund<br>
									6 weeks after the date on the Enrollment Agreement = 60% <br>
